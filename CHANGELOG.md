# Changelog

All notable changes to **Windhawk Themes** are documented here. One entry per update (`## YYYY-MM-DD - HH:MM`), newest first. Each entry has at most one `Added`, `Removed`, `Changed`, and `Fixed` section — omit sections with no items, and put every item of a type in that type's single list (never a second section of the same type). Items are `- **Title**: description` with nested `**Title**: description` sub-items as needed. Releases use Semantic Versioning tags (e.g. `v0.1.0`, `v0.2.0`) with zero attached assets.

## 2026-10-10 - 12:38

### Removed
- **Start Menu High-Contrast Fix (Rolled Back)**: The removal of the `Border#MainMenuHighContrastBorder` / `Border#RightCompanionHighContrastBorder` `Visibility=Collapsed` override was reverted — it damaged the actual Start Menu styling (the borders affect normal-mode rendering). The override remains in the config; a correct high-contrast-neutral fix is a pending task.
- **Taskbar Selector & Transform Cleanup (Rolled Back)**: The bare-type `FlyoutPresenter` / `MenuFlyoutPresenter > Border` / `MenuFlyoutSubItem` targets and the two `RenderTransform` overrides in `windows-11-taskbar-styler.yml` were restored. They were not the `explorer.exe` crash source — root cause is the external `file-operations-styler` companion mod — and their removal undid intended styling.

### Changed
- **Styler Config Tidiness**: Dropped empty scaffolding keys (`theme: ''`, `themeResourceVariables:`, `clickThroughTaskbar: 0`, `xamlDiagnosticsHandling: ''`, `disableNewStartMenuLayout: ''`) and applied theme tokens (`$Background` / `$BorderBrush` / `$BorderThickness`) to the `TaskbarSearchPage` `OuterBorderGrid` block.
- **Target Catalog**: Restored the high-contrast border row in `docs/_wiki/start-menu-styler/targets/elements.md` to match the current Start Menu config.

## 2026-10-09 - 13:55

### Added
- **Collection Index Pages**: Created `docs/_docs/index.md` (`permalink: /docs/`) and `docs/_wiki/index.md` (`permalink: /wiki/`) to guarantee clean, 404-free directory entry points for both collections.

### Changed
- **Extensionless Directory Permalinks**: Updated `docs/_config.yml` collection permalinks from `:path.html` to clean `:path/` (`/:collection/:path/`), resolving GitHub Pages 404 routing errors.
- **Purpose-Named Site Pages**: Renamed all wiki overview files from `README.md` to `overview.md` and `index.md`, enforcing the architectural rule that `README.md` files are strictly repo-only indexes and excluded from GitHub Pages builds.
- **Dynamic Liquid URL Resolution**: Refactored `default.html`, `docs.html`, and `wiki.html` to eliminate hardcoded `.html` extensions and resolve URLs natively via `doc.url`.

## 2026-10-09 - 13:45

### Added
- **Multi-Collection Jekyll Architecture** (`docs/_docs/`, `docs/_wiki/`): Transitioned GitHub Pages site to first-class Jekyll collections with dedicated directories `_docs/` (developer guides) and `_wiki/` (technical styler targets & schemas), providing clean routing (`/docs/:path.html` and `/wiki/:path.html`).
- **Dedicated Page Layouts** (`docs/_layouts/`):
  - **`default.html`**: Default layout for root pages outside collections (`index.md`), featuring the original responsive sidebar shell, brand mark, navbar, and footer.
  - **`docs.html`**: Specialized developer guide layout with reading flow, section breadcrumbs, reading pagers, and quick-jump banner to the wiki.
  - **`wiki.html`**: Just-the-Docs inspired wiki layout with an interactive client-side target search/filter box, hierarchical styler navigation tree, deep breadcrumbs, GitHub edit links, and topic pagers using the custom frosted dark palette.

### Changed
- **Pure Markdown Site Migration**: Converted all pages to pure GitHub Flavored Markdown (`index.md`) with explicit YAML frontmatter.
- **Detailed Jekyll Configuration** (`docs/_config.yml`): Fully expanded configuration with Kramdown GFM, Rouge syntax highlighting, plugin whitelisting, and per-collection/per-scope cascade defaults for `default`, `docs`, and `wiki` layouts.

## 2026-10-09 - 13:15

### Changed
- **Mandatory Theme Neutrality Invariant (Rule 08)**: Codified strict requirements in `Rule 08` (`documentation-standards.md`), `AGENTS.md`, and `docs-specialist.md` mandating that all documentation (`docs/`) and community wiki pages (`docs/wiki/`) remain completely neutral and ignorant of custom themes in `projects/`, focusing exclusively on valid visual tree targets and official mod schemas.
- **Site Theme Boundary**: Formally delineated that non-wiki pages in `docs/` rely exclusively on our custom GitHub Pages site theme, while the `just-the-docs` Jekyll theme is scoped strictly to the `docs/wiki/` folder.

## 2026-10-09 - 13:10

### Added
- **Comprehensive Development Wiki Expansion** (`docs/wiki/`): Built an extensive, deep developer wiki across all five primary styler mods with 14 dedicated documentation files. Added exhaustive visual tree topology diagrams, complete selector tables with verified Windows 11 build ranges, top-level YAML configuration schemas (`styleConstants`, `themeResourceVariables`, `controlStyles`, `webContentStyles`, `backgroundTranslucentEffect`), process host migration notes (`ShellHost.exe` vs `ShellExperienceHost.exe`), and companion mod settings guides.
- **Nested Wiki Navigation**: Registered all 14 wiki pages in `docs/_data/navigation.yml` with structured subcategory links for seamless navigation.

### Changed
- **Mod Default Schema Standardization**: Removed all user/suite theme configurations and presets from the developer wiki. Standardized all companion and configuration reference tables to document system and official mod defaults only.

## 2026-10-09 - 12:40

### Added
- **Community Wiki Section** (`docs/wiki/`): Established a dedicated living knowledge base on the GitHub Pages site organized by the five base styler mods (`start-menu-styler/`, `taskbar-styler/`, `notification-center-styler/`, `file-explorer-styler/`, `settings-styler/`) with nested subcategories (`targets/`, `configurations/`, `companions/`) for community contributions.
- **Whitelisted Gitignored Directories**: Added whitelisted `README.md` files to all repository-used gitignored directories (`.backups/`, `scratch/`, `tools/native/build/`, `tools/native/bin/`) to ensure directory structures appear on remote while internal data and binaries remain strictly untracked.

### Changed
- **Zero Automated Dangerous Git Operations (Rule 00)**: Codified strict per-occurrence user authorization for all potentially dangerous Git commands (`commit`, `push`, `reset`, `restore`, `clean`, `rebase`, `branch -D`) across `agent-safety-compliance.md`, `orchestrator.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Mandated that permissions never persist across tasks or turns.
- **Framework-First Documentation Sync**: Refactored `index.html`, `Getting-Started.md`, `Architecture.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `TODO.md`, `PLAN.md`, and `BUGS.md` to center the repository on the universal theme engineering framework and tools rather than single-project specificity.

## 2026-10-09 - 11:55

### Added
- **GitHub Pages Documentation Site** (`docs/`): Scaffolded complete Jekyll documentation site matching HELIX-Origin architecture (`_config.yml`, `_layouts/documentation.html`, `_includes/translate-control.html`, `_data/languages.yml`, `_data/navigation.yml`, `assets/css/site.css`, `assets/js/mermaid-init.js`, `assets/js/translate.js`, `index.html`, and `README.md`).
- **Comprehensive Surface & Tooling Guides**: Published dedicated guides covering all 5 base styler mods (`Start-Menu.md`, `Taskbar.md`, `Notification-Center.md`, `Settings.md`, `File-Explorer.md`), the hybrid inspection toolchain (`Toolchain.md`, `Diagnostics.md`), manual visual tree inspection (`UWPSpy.md`), and engineering standards (`Syntax-Standards.md`, `Glass-Recipes.md`, `Evidence-Protocol.md`, `Verification.md`).

### Changed
- **Repository Remote Rename & Metadata**: Successfully renamed repository on GitHub to `Windhawk-Themes` via GitHub CLI, synchronized local remote URLs, updated description, and configured 10 repository topics (`windhawk`, `windhawk-mod`, `windows-11`, `windows-customization`, `theme`, `xaml`, `winui`, `styling`, `shell`, `dark-theme`).
- **Milestone-Based Releases & Tracking (Rule 09)**: Updated Rule 09 (`milestone-standards.md`) and tracking templates to codify milestone-based release versions and git tags (e.g. `M.01`, `M.02b`, `M.03`) with zero attached assets.
- **Universal Multi-Project Structure**: Completed full repository migration from `src/` to `projects/<project>/` (`projects/command-center/`), tracked `.agents/projects/` in Git, generalized universal rules, and updated static validation tools (`Test-WindhawkStyles.ps1`).

### Added
- **Unified Hybrid XAML Inspector** (`tools/inspect_xaml.py` & `tools/native/`): Rebuilt the visual tree inspection toolchain into a high-performance hybrid system. Native C++ TAP engine (`xaml_dump.exe` + `xaml_dump_agent.dll` via `xamlOM.h`) injects into shell processes with a 30-second heartbeat wait loop to eliminate premature timeouts during OS elevation / permission prompts.
- **Automated Surface Activation**: Automatically sends key chords (`start` = Win, `action-center` = Win+A, `notification-center` = Win+N, `search` = Win+S) to force background UWP shell processes to render and populate active visual trees, automatically closing them with Escape upon completion.
- **ShareX Screenshot Integration**: Added `--screenshot` (`-ss`) support in `tools/inspect_xaml.py` that dynamically reads user keybinds from `HotkeysConfig.json` (supporting systems where PrintScreen maps to `VK_SLEEP`) and captures live surfaces to the configured ShareX screenshot destination.
- **Organized Scratch Workspace**: Enforced strict format/content-type subfolder organization in `scratch/` (`powershell/`, `python/`, `json/`, `images/`, `docs/`, `text/`, `cpp/`, `yml/`) with dynamic subfolder creation for any newly introduced file types.

### Changed
- **Start Menu Styler** (`src/windows-11-start-menu-styler.yml`): Implemented Flyout separated-island architecture with transparent outer drop-shadow frame, top header island, and layered two-tone split (`Border#AcrylicOverlay` with `$ElementBackground`) hosting the hoisted navigation pane (`Grid#NavPanePlaceholder`). Preserved compact 2-column categories, 3-column pinned list, custom view pills, and Phone Link companion cards. Purged unneeded external targets (widgets, clock, media targets).
- **Agent Ecosystem Synchronization**: Updated `AGENTS.md`, Rule 00 (`agent-safety-compliance.md`), Rule 05 (`surface-scope-standards.md`), `skills/live-visual-inspection.md`, `skills/README.md`, and sub-agent `visual-inspector.md` to reflect the hybrid inspector toolchain, UI automation conventions, ShareX integration, and scratch workspace standards.
- **Removed Deprecated Tool Clutter**: Purged obsolete `tools/xaml_inspect/` module; cleaned and unified tools directory while strictly preserving `Test-WindhawkStyles.ps1` and `style-baseline.ini`.

## 2026-10-08 - 03:16

### Added
- **Native C++ XAML inspector** (`tools/native/`): High-performance headless toolchain consisting of `xaml_dump.exe` (CLI driver) and `xaml_dump_agent.dll` (in-process TAP agent) built with MSVC 2026 and Windows 11 SDK `10.0.26100.0`. Uses Microsoft's official COM diagnostics APIs (`xamlOM.h`, `InitializeXamlDiagnosticsEx`, `IVisualTreeServiceCallback2`) to capture true live visual trees including layout containers (`Grid`, `Border`, `Canvas`, `ContentPresenter`) that standard UI Automation hides.
- **Overlapped IPC & AppContainer security**: Implements non-blocking overlapped Named Pipe IPC with SDDL `D:(A;;GA;;;WD)(A;;GA;;;AC)` and AppContainer file permissions (`*S-1-15-2-1:(RX)`), enabling zero-interaction dumps of sandboxed UWP processes (`StartMenuExperienceHost.exe`, `SearchHost.exe`, etc.) without hangs.
- **Native build & lifecycle automation** (`tools/native/build.ps1`): Self-contained build script that isolates compiler objects into `tools/native/build/`, outputs binaries to `tools/native/bin/`, and automatically unloads active agent instances before recompilation.

### Changed
- **CLI launcher** (`tools/inspect_xaml.py`): Updated to directly delegate CLI commands to the high-performance native `tools/native/bin/xaml_dump.exe` binary.
- **`tools/README.md`**: Documented native C++ inspector architecture, compiler toolchain, and CLI usage.

## 2026-10-08 - 01:09

### Added
- **Headless visual tree inspector** (`tools/inspect_xaml.py` + `tools/xaml_inspect/`): Programmatic UWPSpy-style dumps of the seven approved shell processes' live UIA trees as text / JSON / Markdown (per-window 3 s UIA timeouts for hung providers, message-only window inclusion, filter/framework pruning, UTF-8-safe output) — selector discovery without manual inspection burden (Rule 04).
- **`tools/README.md`**: Catalog for all three tools documenting the inspector's three-tier safety contract, consent-gated surface opening, options, and package layout.
- **Consent-gated UI automation**: `--permit-ui-automation` unlocks tier-2 input injection (`SendInput` / `SetCursorPos`) for `--open-surface start|search|action-center|notification-center` (Win / Win+S / Win+A / Win+N) and `--click X Y` (no-shortcut fallback); runs are refused without the flag (exit 3), consent is per-run and never stored, opened surfaces are closed with Escape afterwards (`--leave-open` to skip) — Rule 00.

### Changed
- **Rule 00 (safety)**: Added the UI automation consent policy — explicit per-instance user permission required before each automation run, `LockApp.exe` / the lock screen barred from all automation (locks the system; research-only).
- **Ecosystem docs synced**: `AGENTS.md` capability item 5, Rule 01 approved-tooling line, and the live-visual-inspection skill now describe read-only-by-default with consent-gated surface opening (headless tool preferred; UWPSpy remains fallback).

## 2026-10-07 - 23:13

### Added
- **`.agents/targets/` evidence directory**: Interim home for per-styler selector evidence records (Notification Center and File Explorer restored from git history), with a folder `README.md`; will migrate to `docs/targets/` when the planned GitHub Pages site is built.
- **`root-changelog-file-template.md`**: Blueprint for this changelog in `.agents/templates/`.

### Removed
- **`index.md` files**: Deleted from `.agents/rules/`, `.agents/skills/`, `.agents/templates/`, and `.agents/agents/`; folder `README.md` files are now the canonical indexes (Surface Ownership Matrix merged into `.agents/agents/README.md`).
- **Version metadata**: `1.0.0-preview` removed from `PLAN.md`, `TODO.md`, and `BUGS.md` (the suite has no versions).

### Changed
- **Agent ecosystem realignment**: Full audit of `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/` against repository reality.
  - **Rule 09 reworked**: `release-standards.md` → `milestone-standards.md` ("Milestone & Sprint Tracking Standards"); `release-notes-template.md` → `milestone-summary-template.md`; all SemVer/version/release framing removed project-wide (external Windhawk mod versions retained).
  - **File Explorer deferred (ROADMAP M.03)**: Reframed everywhere with the official rationale — lack of plausible customizations; existing styles too similar; no real benefit yet. Notification Center status corrected to Generated & Verified (polish active — M.02b).
  - **Stale references corrected**: Old styler filenames updated to `windows-11-*-styler.yml`; `docs/targets/` references redirected to interim `.agents/targets/`; `docs/` documented as a planned future GitHub Pages site (deferred until style work completes).
  - **Root tracking templates**: Realigned with the actual root files (including a new changelog blueprint).
- **Documentation sync**: Restructured root `README.md`, `src/README.md`, and `src/extras/README.md` to align with documentation standards (root Markdown files + `src/extras/README.md` + `.agents/`; `docs/` deferred for a planned GitHub Pages site).
- **Static gate**: `pwsh -NoProfile -File tools/Test-WindhawkStyles.ps1` passes — 0 errors, 0 warnings.

## 2026-10-07 - 21:36

### Added
- **`tools/style-baseline.ini`**: Style baseline ledger for pre-existing static-gate warnings.

### Changed
- **Documentation standards**: Updated documentation standards and enhanced companion mod configurations in `src/extras/README.md`.

## 2026-10-05 - 16:26

### Added
- **Design system**: Command Center Glass design language (frosted blur, top-lit rim, harmonized radii, theme-aware materials).
- **Base styler YAMLs**: `src/windows-11-taskbar-styler.yml`, `src/windows-11-start-menu-styler.yml`, and `src/windows-11-notification-center-styler.yml` with canonical style constants.
- **Extras configurations**: Dynamic Island, Enhanced Disk Usage, File Operations Styler, Fully Customizable Winver, Shell Flyout Positions, Start Button Colorizer, Taskbar Clock Customization, Taskbar Tray and Icon Tweaks.
- **Agent ecosystem**: `.agents/` with rules (00–09), agents, skills, and templates; root tracking files `PLAN.md`, `TODO.md`, `BUGS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`.
- **Validation tooling**: `tools/Test-WindhawkStyles.ps1` static gate.
- **Target evidence records**: Per-styler selector ledgers (since relocated from `docs/targets/` to interim `.agents/targets/` — git `a4e4c76`).

### Removed
- **File Explorer styler**: Generated, then discontinued per user directive (git `1cc49e9`) — deferred (ROADMAP M.03); rationale: lack of plausible customizations, existing styles too similar, no real benefit yet.

### Changed
- **Notification Center polish**: Iterated styling through several commits; completed live desktop verification (M.02) with follow-up polish tracked under M.02b / W.04.
